This programs goes through various node info and tasks. I do add some node info at the beginning portion of the code.

-append value
-prepend value
-size returns
-head returns
-tail returns
-at index
-pop removes value
-contains a value
-find a value

I often demonstrate my code a few times. While error-handling was not a requirement, I did add some error-handling.
